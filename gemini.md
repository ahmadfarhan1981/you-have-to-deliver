### Direction
Always Use the following guidelines to solve tasks:
1. This codebase is software development company simulation game written in rust with legion ECS and tauri with a Svelte frontend
2. Always use sequential thinking to think through the steps required  to execute the task.
3. Always use context7 in the first step to retrieve and understand the appropriate docs related to this codebase.
4. Verify any assumption by checking the files. Do not continue working based on unverified assumption
5. Test often. Run code incrementally if possible instead of in big chunks.
6. Add test cases related to the change as appropriate.
